"""
ML Module for GNN + LSTM Vulnerability Detection

This module contains the deep learning components for detecting
security vulnerabilities in code using Graph Neural Networks (GNN)
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

Components:
- models: Neural network architectures (GNN, LSTM, Combined)
- data: Data processing (AST parsing, graph construction, tokenization)
- training: Training pipeline and utilities
- inference: Model serving and prediction
- utils: Helper functions and utilities
